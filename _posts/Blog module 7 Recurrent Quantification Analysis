In module 6 we learned about techniques in order to reconstruct phase spaces and how to visualize them.However, we ended the module without a satisfying conclusion about the phase space itself.
In this module we will aim to derive quantitative properties based on the phase space reconstruction.
In order to do so, we will use recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and apply it to a heart rate time series. 

RQA is a technique to quanitify the number and duration of recurrences of a system. Several measures can be derived using RQA which will increase oneâ€™s understanding of the system.
Remember that we obtained two parameters in the previous module: delay = 3500 and embedding dimension = 7. In order to apply RQA we additionally need to determine a radius parameter.
